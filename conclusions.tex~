This thesis consisted on three parts. In the first part the dataset, \emph{Elämä} \emph{Pelissä}, was presented and studied. The data was cleaned, pre-processed and inserted into a custom-made database structure. All this with the purpose of facilitating the exploratory analysis and prediction of health related variables based on individuals' profile values. During this phase the basic statistics of each variable were calculated and outlier elements were removed. The result of this phase facilitated an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), i.e. an approach to answer analytical queries in a fast and reliable way.

For the second part a data exploratory analysis was performed. It was based mainly on the basic statistics of the data and the visualization of the information in different plots. The information extracted during the exploratory analysis present an interesting baseline for further analysis. All the variables were analyzed with different approaches. An advanced script able to work with specific queries and plots was programmed with the sole purpose of finding interesting features that may not be easily visible.

In the third part of the thesis a data modeling approach was performed. Various methodologies were used for regression. The dataset has various elements as empty fields, i.e. missing information. The objective behind the regression methods were to create a model robust enough to predict these missing variables by using the available ones. Different configuration of linear models were tested; to complement them Forward stepwise selection and SISAL algorithms were used. The information obtained by these methodologies was feed into different multilayer perceptron networks; another test consisted on doing regression by means of principal component discriminant scores. The employment of fixed variables Sex and Age did improve the regression for single variable predictor models. Sex and Age showed to be relevant discriminant variables that shall be kept in mind for further analysis.

When using the variable selection algorithms, Forward stepwise and SISAL, interesting things were found. Both methodologies aim to reduce the number of necessary variables as much as possible while improving the quality of the model, i.e they follow a parsimonious approach. SISAL demonstrated to be better than Forwards stepwise selection, the improvement difference is noticeable for some of the variables. However, SISAL was more dense in the number of variables selected, therefore providing a more complex model. The algorithms' different selection mechanism may be the cause of this difference. Forward stepwise increases the number of variables as a gain in the fit of the data while SISAL, on the other hand, reduces the number of variables based on the least significant variable.

In general, the work done provided large quantities of information and hints that may require further and deeper analysis. As consequence the work provided a structured baseline in which future work could be done over the dataset. The dataset provided detailed information that may not be available in smaller-scale questionnaires. The findings, related to the Finnish way of living and its population, may be of interest to the involved entities Duodecim and THL; they may provide further hints to focus the research. This thesis presented the initial round of findings and could be easily extended into more in-depth areas as required. On the technical side this thesis presented a complete data mining approach to a real life dataset, including detailed information on how to work and what to do with the data at each phase.

\section{Future research}
\label{s:futureWork}

The research done for this thesis had a limited scope. In the regression analysis only continuous variables were used, for example. The analysis of discrete variables could be part of future research. Different approaches could be used for this purpose, e.g.  Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for regression purpose \cite{hastie}. Continuous variables could be integrated in the regression if correctly discretized. Within the available discretization methods the one investigated was Histogram Analysis, in which the histogram distribution of the corresponding variable is used as a way to discretize it \cite{han}.

A large dataset, as the one used for this thesis, could return interesting information if it is clustered correctly. Because of the data content there are some variables that could be used for ``natural'' clustering, i.e. dividing the dataset in different subsets using only the different categories of the selected variables. Sex and Age are important variables to keep in mind for this case; they played an important role when fixed for the regression models for single variable predictor as well as the polynomial approach. More advanced clustering methods could be useful to find different groups of people with similar profiles characteristics. The use of $k$-means and $x$-means could be an efficient way to find these clusters \cite{xmeans}. Mixture models and Bayesian networks could also be used as methodologies for the analysis of the data.
