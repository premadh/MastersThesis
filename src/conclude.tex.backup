As shown in Figure \ref{Fig:problem} this thesis focused on data transformation methods for changing the representation of the data in different resolution with the goal of database integration. The mixture modelling approach was then applied to the data in a single resolution. However, the field still lacks many methods and algorithms that can enhance the analysis of data in multiple resolutions without the need for transformation between different resolutions. The field seeks the  design and implementation of a multiresolution mixture model to work with multiple resolution of the data simultaneously as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:solution}.

The problem was studied only at chromosome level and the data transformation process was defined only in different resolutions of the chromosome. In the future work, the data transformation process can be defined until the very minute biological details such as genes.The simple upsampling technique used in the thesis also needs further investigation and inferencing techniques can be implemented. Figure \ref{Fig:solution} shows the solution studied in Master's thesis and the possible directions for the future research in the designing of the multiresolution mixture model. In further work the probabilistic models, such as mixture models and probabilistic time series models, such as Hidden Markov Models(HMMs) can be extended to cope with data in multiple resolutions. This requires changing the model representation, but it is not straightforward to see how inference and learning procedures should be changed for best results. The designed model should provide a novel means to work on the multiple resolutions of the chromosomal data. Since multiresolution data occurs normally in various fields such as telecommunication industry, image processing; design and implementation of multiresolution mixture will provide other related fields also an opportunity to use the mixture models.
