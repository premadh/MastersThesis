My Master's thesis research project has been carried out in the Parsimonious Modelling group from the Helsinki Institute of Information Technology at TKK. More than everything it has been a learning experience. I want to thank my lab partners Mika, Mikko, Janne and Miguel for their willingness to help. Big thanks also go to my instructor Jaakko Hollmén for trusting in me for this project. His dedication, simple solutions and interesting comments made the work more fun.

Professor Erkki Oja and post-doc Tapani Raiko were always supportive during the master, providing information, signing papers and helping me with the burdens of my scholarship. Each one of the professor and teachers that instructed me during this two years I thank you. I may not be able to see further than the giants but I am able to see a piece of what the giants see and that's amazing.

My master degree mates László, Du\^{s}an and Stevan, because of all the ideas, experiences and \emph{code} we shared. The new generation guys Li, Prem and Agha because the best way to learn something is by explaining it; I really enjoyed that you trusted me in so many things.

Finland for being such a great country and teaching me so much; do not let it forget its high standards always aiming for equality and prosperity.

My gratitude also goes to my two families, my mom Lucero, dad Luis and my \emph{new} mom and dad Noemi and Armando. My brother Pepe, sisters Lucy, Lulu and Martha; because you all make the journey easier. Although your addiction to Finnish chocolate is impossible to maintain.

Finally, I would like from the hearth thank my wife Aime who has always supported me with belief and love. Walking always together under the sun under the moon; all this is yours.
