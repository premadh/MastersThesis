Cancer (Medically: \emph {Malignant Neoplasm }) is a disease characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells; their ability to migrate to other parts of human body and destroy the neighboring cells and tissues \cite{cancer}. The lack of proper care can be fatal in cancer cases. Consider, for example, some statistics: cancer accounted for 7.4 million deaths worldwide (13\% of the total deaths) in 2004 \{Source: World Health Organization(WHO), fact-sheet\}. In the United States, cancer caused 0.56 million deaths (23.1\% of all deaths) in 2005 \{Source: American Cancer Society\}. Finland also has a high number of cancer cases; 26,279 new cancer cases were reported in 2007, by 2015 it is expected to reach 30,000 \{Source: Cancer Society of Finland\}. It is estimated that more than one-third of the population will develop some form of cancer during their lifetime. %\cite{somethinghere}.
Cancers can infect at any age but is more common in the older population. As the people have started living longer, the problems with cancer is bound to increase in the near future. Because of the catastrophic effects of cancers and their increasing numbers, cancer is a highly researched in different diversified aspects and areas.


Ever since the concept of Evidence-based medicine was promulgated in the early 1960s by a Scottish Professor Archie Cochrane \cite{thatreviewarticle} in his book ``\textit{ Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services}'', a variety of different engineering tools and techniques have been used in medicine. Several ICT and computational methods such as Telemedicine, Medical imaging, Electronic Patients records have already been deployed with excellent results in hospitals and medical centers. Recently, there have been tremendous improvements in technology especially in hardware and software related to computers. Computers have increasing speed, hard-drives have increased storage space, ultra-modern computer architecture, and improved communication and internet have increased the ease of manipulation and sharing of data and resources among different communities and regions. Thus, data related to diseases, such as cancers, is efficiently stored and readily available .


On the other hand, biological systems are very complex systems. Since these complexities are directly related to the health of humans, different technologies have been developed to study them. Micro-array technology, such as CGH (Comparative genomic hybridization)\cite{cgh} and aCGH (Array comparative genomic hybridization) \cite{acgh} have given the facilities to study the genomes and the genes in human body. CGH is one of the molecular technique to survey the DNA copy number variation across whole genome. In CGH experiment, differentially labelled test and reference genomic DNAs are co-hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes. Fluorescence ratios along the length of the chromosome provide a cytogenetic representation of DNA copy number variation. However, one major drawback of CGH is the resolution. The mapping resolution is only 20Mb. In addition to that mapping resolution for deletion is 2Mbp. To overcome the problem of CGH, a new microarray technology called aCGH has been developed. aCGH provides higher resolution than CGH. Fluorescence ratios at arrayed DNA elements provide a locus by locus measure of copy number changes. These technologies have varying uses including the gene expression analysis, detecting aberrations in genes and chromosomes and also have left a positive impact on cancer research. Furthermore, completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 has opened an interesting area of research in computational genomics. The most common aspects of all these techniques is that they produce data in astronomical proportions. For instance, the third generation of DNA sequencers will generate many petabytes\footnote{1 petabyte is equal to 1024 terabytes(TB) or 1,048,576 gigabytes(GB).} of information a year. The introduction and application of these methods in cancer research has led to the accumulation of the data at exponential rates. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand complex biological systems from these huge amount of data which involves analysis of the data exploded by those experiments. This is where a relatively newer field of machine learning(ML) and data mining(DM) is increasingly finding its way in medical field, especially in cancer research.


Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence incorporating a myriad of statistical, probabilistic and optimization techniques thus allowing computers to learn from past examples to help detect and discover meaningful patterns from large, noisy and complex data sets \cite{mitchell} \cite{hykin} \cite{bishop}. Machine learning encompasses a variety of methods, including classification, regression, clustering, pattern discovery with varying applications, such as object recognition in computer vision, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, brain-machine interfaces, classifying DNA sequences, speech and handwriting recognition. The machine learning and data mining community, although a relatively newer field, have already developed a cohort of many fascinating algorithms, interesting ways to handle the concept classes and elegant and clever ways to search through huge databases. The medical field can, therefore, reap the benefits of these methods and adapt these methods for their use in ever increasing medical data.


Recently, machine learning methods are increasingly used in cancer research because of its versatility, sheer volume of data generated by the biological experiments, dramatic growth in new scientific questions, and new challenges for learning and inference. The presence of massive populationwide, life-long, trans-generational, and electronically accessible datasets obligates the use of machine learning and data mining methods in health-care and medicine although it brings along with it the problem of privacy\footnote {This thesis does not consider the issue of privacy. This is, perhaps, first and last time the word privacy is used}. Different classification methods are used for cancer diagnosis, clustering for prognosis and tumor class discovery, and feature selection for bio-marker identification \cite{mlforcr}.  The concept of \textbf{personalized medicine}\footnote{One United States Senate Bill (proposed law) defines personalized medicine as \emph {the application of genomic and molecular data to better target the delivery of health care, facilitate the discovery and clinical testing of new products, and help determine a person's predisposition to a particular disease or condition.}}, which is essentially a set of methods to map diagnostic results to therapies in cancer cases, has led to the application of different novel machine learning methods. Furthermore, a variety of new scientific and clinical problems introduced almost everyday, necessitate  the  development of novel supervised and unsupervised learning methods to use these growing resources in terms of data and knowledge. Cancer genomics is a highly researched area producing significant amount of data and questions for the research.

It is also important to note that cancer is a multifactorial\footnote{Here multifactorial is used to mean there are many factors causing cancer. Majority of the noninfectious diseases are multifactorial.} disease \cite{Myllykangas200815}. For example, it is well known that smoking causes cancer, but all cancers are not caused by smoking and all the people who smoke will not get infected by cancer. However, all the cancer cases incorporate some form of genetic changes in human beings. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Humans being a diploid organism have two homologous copies of each chromosome usually with one inherited from the father and the other from the mother. During the complex process of cell division, some abnormalities can occur in the cells and copy number changes from two. The reasons for such abnormalities have not been identified yet but even the latest studies \cite{lateststudies} believe in the abnormality of chromosomes as a cause of cancer. It is, however, important to note that fork stalling and template switching, a replication misstep have been attributed to such abnormalities \cite{abnormality}. Deletion is the case when the copy number is less than two. Duplication is the case when the copy number is more than two. Amplification is the special case of duplication where the copy number increases more than 5. Chromosomal aberrations such as DNA amplifications, deletion, duplication have significant roles in cancer research. DNA copy number amplifications have been defined as the the hallmarks of cancer\cite{Tikka2007972}. 

This thesis aims to present a mixture modeling approach to reveal the structure in the amplification patterns of human cancer patients. The use of this approach is motivated by the fact that cancer is not a single disease but a collective term for a class of diseases with some similarity. As the classes are different, causes of cancers also differ among different types of cancers. Mixture models usually thrive in modeling such heterogeneous data generated from different classes. These models can be used to develop generic models to combine the samples from different sub-population\footnote{Subpopulation is used here to mean different types of cancers}. The model based clustering approach is used to optimally divide the data into clusters. A novel stratified cross-validation technique is used to learn the model i.e. the number of subpopulation that the data supports. The parameters of the mixture models are learned from the data using the Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm \cite{wolfe}\cite{expectmax} . The chromosome-wise modeling generates a probability distribution to express the amplification patterns in cancer for each chromosome. This probability distribution can be used for the classification of different types of cancer.
