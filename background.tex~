\chapter{Background}
\label{c:background}

In this thesis a dataset is analyzed the later being the result of a web test prepared by various institutions from Finland. The dataset contains information regarding the life styles or life's risk the Finnish population has at present time. The original test was presented as an interactive part of a television show called \emph{Elämä Pelissä}\,\footnote{Elämä Pelissä can be roughly translated in English as: \emph{Life at stake}.}. The television show was used as an incentive mechanism for the population to go and answer the web test form where important factors were captured. The web test was answered by approximately half a million Finns. Although this is a large number, the test does not assure the independence of answers, i.e. one person could have answered the test several times. Nevertheless, half a million people account for almost 10\% of the total Finnish population. The television show was a part of the Finnish broadcasting company YLE during the year 2007. It was created by YLE with the support of Duodecim and the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL in Finnish).

Duodecim is a Finnish medical society playing an important role in the Finnish national health care they have cooperation with different organization and officials \cite{duo}. Duodecim has supported this research by providing the author of the thesis with the original dataset.

Another participant supporting the research is THL. A research unit inside THL has been doing the FINRISK study since 1972, this study takes place every 5 years. The study is based on a survey on risk factors of chronic noncommunicable diseases. It uses random and representative population samples from all Finland. Datasets resulting of the FINRISK surveys are used for a number of different research projects and for national health monitoring needs \cite{thl}. Besides the contribution of THL to the development of the on-line test they also contributed with the algorithm that calculates the life expectancy of a person given a set of input variables. The FINRISK life expectancy algorithm is based on 37+ inputs, i.e. answers to different questions. Thus the users filling up the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test are able to predict their life expectancy.

\section{Elämä Pelissä : The test}
\label{s:epTheTest}

In Finland the life expectancy 100 years ago was just above 40 years; now that expectancy has almost doubled \cite{elamaP}. Individuals are free to take their own decision and select their own choices on how their health and life expectancy is affected. Most of the Finnish people already know, or think that they know, how to improve their life and avoid health problems. However, many things that are considered important are not that important or have not been proved important, e.g. eat more vegetables instead of stop smoking \cite{elamaP}.

The \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test consists of 39 questions regarding the individual's living conditions, lifestyle, social relationships and experiences in different areas. Accurate answers to these questions will facilitate the prediction of ``How long will the individual live?''. The test can be taken as many times as wished; this openness is with the sole purpose of showing the individuals what changes in his/her actual life style could improve or worsen his/her health \cite{elamaP}.

The test consists of 39 question considered key life factors. Of course the existence of more factors that could affect the prediction is known, e.g. hereditary diseases or genetic issues. Nevertheless, to keep the test accurate and at the same time simple to an average public, specific or personal factors were not taken into account. The impact these factors may play, regarding the length of a life is limited, additionally individuals do not have enough information at hand \cite{elamaP}. For example cancer, in some cases is hereditary while in other cases not; therefore asking a question related to this disease is irrelevant. Other cases, e.g. glucose or sodium content in the blood, are difficult questions to ask as the answers are hardly known by individuals and could not be calculated by them without a laboratory study.

A descriptive list of the questions is in Appendix \ref{app:A}. More information about the questions and importance of each one is available in \cite{elamaP}.

\section{Elämä Pelissä : Life expectancy prediction}
\label{s:epLifePrediction}

As previously noticed the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test is used to do a life forecast, i.e. predict how long a person is going to live according to the given input (answer to questions). The forecast takes into account a large number of factors. The test provides accurate forecasts of life for people between 25 and 74 years of age that do not have any \emph{hard} illness affecting them, e.g. cancer or heart problems \cite{elamaP}. The forecast is calculated based on the average figure of similar responses based on health monitoring. However, the use of the average, although complete and simple, discards the well known individual variations. In general, the individual variations are considered insignificant compared to the majority of the cases; therefore, affecting little the results. It is worth mentioning that the major impact factors are Smoking and Alcohol consumption. Nevertheless, all the factors, even simple ones, contribute to the prediction.

The base average of life expectancy is reported each year by Statistics Finland\footnote{Statistics Finland is a Finnish government agency dedicated to produce statistics and information services for the needs of society \myurl{http://www.stat.fi}}. The life expectancy works so that the older a person is the older he is expected to live. Table \ref{tab:expMW} exhibit the life expectancy for men and women.

When gathering the information it is normal that some input variables are mistaken or omitted. This is due to typo mistakes or respondents lack of knowledge, e.g. it is not common for people to know their diastole pressure in mmHg. The algorithm will use the population average (mean predictor) or if possible some related questions to predict the erroneous/missing variable.

The problem of missing variables will be one of the topics later explored within this thesis. In the following chapters there are studies on how to do better than the mean predictor by means of other known variables. The mean predictor although simple and in many cases good enough is not the best approach to solve the missing variable problem, specially when a lot of information is available and DM/ML methods could be used. Replacing the missing data with the mean is known to produce biased estimates, see \cite{missingD}, especially if the replaced variable is important for the estimation; therefore, this method shall be avoided if other approaches are available.

A similar project predicting for how long one is going to live has been developed by the University of Pennsylvania in \cite{lifePredictor}. They proposed a short and a long version of what they call \emph{life calculator}. The data and predictions are focused to Americans (USA); therefore, they claim, the forecast may not be accurate for other nationalities. A similar behavior shall be expected for the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} predictor, i.e. it will work better with Finns than other nationalities. The questions used by the life calculator are similar to those in the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test. For example, they ask about education, smoking behavior, occupation activities and blood pressure. However, they have a complete different section where they ask questions related to possible hereditary diseases; like heart problems and colorectal cancer, for example.

Another interesting study has been done in \cite{predictionHumanLife}. Initially they comment that during the last century the average live expectancy has increased dramatically in the industrialized countries; they claim that in America (USA) the increase has been of almost four fold. This drastic change however, is not an evolutionary change because the number of generations coexisting in a century is too small to have pushed a genetic change. The claim is that there are other factors affecting the aging process. In their study they model the demographic changes in human population simulating the conditions that expanded humans life expectancy.  Therefore, seeking to find which other variables play an important role in the prediction of life expectancy.

Contrary to the previous papers, about an increment in the expectancy of life, in the study presented by the authors of \cite{obesityUSA} the future may be different. In their study they find out that  increasing obesity will play an important role by reducing the life expectancy of people from two to five years, specially in the US. Obesity is related to hearth problems, hypertension, diabetes, and some kinds of cancers. Obesity can be considered an epidemic, two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. Therefore, future generations will live less healthy and possibly even shorter lives than their parents. This, although not in-line with a life expectancy predictor, gives important information on how one variable, weight, may play a decisive role.

A parsimonious model of life expectancy is proposed in the research of \cite{parsLife}. In this case the model has been called ``subjective life expectancy'', i.e. it is based on the peoples belief and not on the objective survival rates (what has been studied and recorded in reality). Initially they noticed that on average young respondents underestimate their true survival probability whereas old subjects overestimate their survival probability. To generate a model based on these issues it is necessary that the Bayesian model should be prone to psychological attitudes. The model developed in their paper allows the possibility of subjective belief that express ambiguity. That is, the survival is downward biased at younger ages and upward biased at older ages. This model is considered as a Bayesian learning model with a psychological bias. The generated model was able to fit the subjective beliefs correctly.

\section{Elämä Pelissä : Related research}
\label{s:epRelatedResearch}

The \emph{Elämä Pelissä} dataset is a vast source of information. Many aspects of it should be of interest for doctors, insurance companies, the government, etc. Of course, the dataset shall not be considered a strict and confident set of answers. The limitations in security and confidentiality that a web survey has put a bias on the obtained results. However, the large number of respondents (half a million) should counter balance the possible existing bias, reducing it to a minimal problem. Some of the answers observed in the test could be compared to more strict studies to provide some confidence. Plenty of research have been done related to health issues in Finland. The following papers were chosen and analyzed because they, in some degree, use the same variables as the ones available in the dataset.

In \cite{aCarotid} it is stated that there is a direct association between alcohol consumption and the increase of carotid Intima-Media Thickness (IMT); this independently of age, sex and other factors, e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol levels or BMI. The authors worked with 2,074 individuals for the analysis. The participants were asked to report their alcohol consumption in different categories (similar to those of the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test) to determinate their total alcohol consumption. To complement the test other lifestyle information was asked, for example, education, smoking, physical activity, etc. Therefore, the questionnaire used was very similar to the one analyzed in this thesis. The correlations between the different risk factors and IMT were calculated using a stepwise linear regression model. In their findings they observe that for heavy drinkers a significant increase of arterial augmentation is noticeable; supporting the statement that increased alcohol consumption is related to vascular damage in young adults especially among men. Other findings include that the frequency of wine consumption was directly correlated with carotid IMT, independent of age, sex and other cardiovascular risk factors. Nevertheless, they conclude their study was limited due to the small number of subjects drinking wine daily, hence, limiting the previous conclusion.

In another study by the authors of \cite{aMortality} the connection between alcohol-related mortality to age and sex is analyzed. The study estimates the impact of excessive alcohol use on life expectancy by sex. The study assumes that the mortality risk to alcohol-related causes is independent of all other mortality risks. The study was done with the data available from the official death register maintained by Statistics Finland. Findings state that four out of ten alcohol-related deaths were directly attributable to alcohol; another four were accidental and violent deaths with alcohol-related contribution to the cause of death; the remaining two were deaths from disease related to alcohol consumption. Deaths from disease with an alcohol-related contribution were eight times more common among men than women. Alcohol-related accidental and violent deaths were almost 9 times more common among men. An interesting impact of alcohol found by the study is that alcohol reduced the life expectancy in women by 0.4 years and by 2.0 years in men. However, smoking reduces the life expectancy, at age 15, by 2.6 years among men and 0.3 years among women, making smoking a more important cause of life reduction in men and a similar cause in women.

The paper of \cite{smoking} reports on how smoking affects the quality of life of men and women in Finland. Previous studies have shown that tobacco consumption has a direct impact on the quality of life. The study divided the population into four categories depending on their smoking behavior: daily, occasional, ex-smoker and never-a-smoker. The previous classification question was complemented by asking the individuals an estimation of their quality of life by rating how good their present life has been. Fifteen additional questions related to discomforts were also asked, the answers ranged from 0 to 1. The study was performed separately for men and women. The influential variables used were age, marital status, education and income. The findings show that compared to never-smokers daily smokers were associated with lower scores, i.e. worst feelings; in 9 of the 15 variables tested among men, for example sleeping distress and vitality. Smoking women showed also low values. Consequently, daily smokers have a lower quality of live compared to never smokers among both, men and women. However, the paper concludes that the numerical differences, although existent, are too small to consider smoking as a valid influence on the quality of life.

In the area of physical activities the paper of \cite{pActivity} is a study about physical activity among the Finnish youth. The study initially states that the increase of obesity and the decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness among young people can be attributed to the large amount of time spent watching TV (or computer screens or playing video games). The study comprises 7,344 children from the northern regions of Finland (Lapland and Oulu). The subjects were asked about their daily physical activities, in ranges of 20 minutes; from 0 minutes to at least 1 hour per day. Corresponding to their sedentary behavior they were asked about the amount spent on watching TV, reading books, at the computer and/or playing video games. The results showed that boys are more physically active than girls; approximately 20\% of the subjects participate in moderate to vigorous physical activities. On the contrary, 50\% of the subjects do watch TV for more than 2 hours per day. However, the assumption that TV incites inactivity showed some contradiction; in some individuals (43\% of boys, 23\% of girls) watching 4 or more hours TV also included high levels of physical activities.

Related to diet and food intake there is the study of \cite{finnishDiet}. In the study it is analyzed the consumption of \emph{polyphenols}\,\footnote{Polyphenols are a group of chemical substances mainly found in fruits like berries and vegetables like cocoa or coffee.} in Finnish adults. The polyphenols are known of having a beneficial effect on human health and they also provides protection against chronic and cardiovascular diseases. The study was done to 2,007 adults between 25 and 64 years of age. The daily mean intake of polyphenos is 863mg/d with a higher intake by men than women. It was noticed that in the list of 20 foods with the highest total polyphenol concentrations 16 were berries; in beverages the highest concentrations was found in coffee (Finnish diet is well known for high consumption of berries and coffee).

In the area of work and stress there is the study of \cite{stressBMI} where they analyze the relation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and stress at work. Obesity is known to be related to an interaction between biological and environmental factors. Therefore, the claim that the increasing proportion of obese people and the increase in stress related to a working life could be connected. The study covered more than 45,000 employees; besides weight, height and age other variables were studied. These variables included marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity. These variables were used as predictors of the BMI. In the results it was noticed that the BMI value was higher for men than for women; that the BMI mean increased with age and that the BMI was highly related to socioeconomic status as well as a lower job demand.

These formal studies have two things in common. Firstly, all of them were performed in Finland and among Finnish people. Secondly, the questions used to extract information are very similar within them and in comparison with the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} test, e.g. age, weight, stress, blood pressure, etc. Nevertheless, each study focused on a different area like physical activity or smoking behavior. The interest of these studies, regarding the \emph{Elämä Pelissä} dataset, is that they were mainly limited in the number of participants. With the large data available it may be probable to find new tendencies and/or complement the presented ones. The work of finding multidimensional profiles could be improved by the localization of individual but important factors as, e.g. alcohol or smoking behavior.

The study of this thesis will be, of course, not based in any scientific medical terms, but more in the machine learning data mining science of extracting useful and important information from a large dataset. Of what could be or should be interpreted from the analysis results will depend on the specialists that take a look at them. Some results are expected to be easily interpretable and some may require more specialization.
